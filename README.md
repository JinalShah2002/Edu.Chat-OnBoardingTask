# Edu.Chat-OnBoardingTask
This is Jinal Shah's Edu.Chat OnBoarding Task program 
To run the program, copy the code and paste it into a html code editor.
I used JetBrains Webstorm, however you can use any other HTML code editor,but JetBrains Webstorm makes it so much easier to run.
Then run the code and open it so that you can fill out the form.
Make Sure you open the code in Google Chrome.
Then fill out the form and click submit. 
To check if the data stored in the localStorage database, right click on your mouse and then click inspect.
After that, click on Performance and then Application. 
Then on the Left Side, you should see localStorage.
Then Click on the arrow, which will drop down the database.
Here you will be able to see the data.
To see if the data is still there after you refresh, refresh the page and repeat steps 8-12.
If you have any questions, let me know.
